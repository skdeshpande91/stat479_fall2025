# What is Sports Analytics?

## Statistics vs Analytics

- Sports statistics refer to counts and rates that *summarize* performance:
  - Number of rebounds, wins, games played
  - Free throw percentage, batting average

. . .

- Analytics refers to the use of statistical *modeling* to help gain competitive advantage
  - Analytics makes use of basic statistics & creates new ones
  - Analytics uses data to answer **substantive sports questions**


## "Best"NBA Shooting Performances

- What is the best single-season shooting performance in the NBA?

. . .

- How should we define best?
  - Made the most shots? Highest proportion of made shots?
  - Should 2- and 3-point shots count the same?

. . .

- Data: box scores from each game since 2002-03
- Available from the **hoopR** package
```{r}
#| label: load-data
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
raw_box <-
  hoopR::load_nba_player_box(
    seasons = 2002:(hoopR::most_recent_nba_season()))
```

## Data snapshot
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1|2-3"
raw_box |> dplyr::filter(game_date == "2011-06-12") |>
  dplyr::select(athlete_display_name, 
         field_goals_made, field_goals_attempted)
```
. . .
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
raw_box |> 
  dplyr::filter(game_date == "2011-06-12") |>
  dplyr::select(athlete_display_name, 
         field_goals_made, field_goals_attempted)
```

## Isolating regular season games
```{r}
#| label: preprocess-1
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1-7|9-10"
allstar_dates <- lubridate::date(c("2002-02-10", "2003-02-09", 
    "2004-02-15","2005-02-20", "2006-02-19", "2007-02-18", 
    "2008-02-17", "2009-02-15", "2010-02-14","2011-02-20", 
    "2012-02-26", "2013-02-17", "2014-02-16", "2015-02-15", 
    "2016-02-14","2017-02-19", "2018-02-18", "2019-02-17",
    "2020-02-16", "2021-03-07", "2022-02-20","2023-02-19", 
    "2024-02-18", "2025-02-16"))
reg_box <- raw_box |>
  dplyr::filter(season_type == 2 & 
      !did_not_play & !game_date %in% allstar_dates)
```

## Further preprocessing
- Rename columns & set defaults for players with no minutes
```{r}
#| label: preprocess-2
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1-2|3-7|8-11|"
reg_box <-
  reg_box |>
  dplyr::rename(
    Player = athlete_display_name, 
    FGM = field_goals_made, FGA = field_goals_attempted,
    TPM = three_point_field_goals_made,TPA = three_point_field_goals_attempted,
    FTM = free_throws_made, FTA = free_throws_attempted) |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    FGM = ifelse(is.na(minutes), 0, FGM), FGA = ifelse(is.na(minutes), 0, FGA),
    TPM = ifelse(is.na(minutes), 0, TPM),TPA = ifelse(is.na(minutes), 0, TPA),
    FTM = ifelse(is.na(minutes), 0, FTM),FTA = ifelse(is.na(minutes), 0, FTA)) |>
  tidyr::replace_na(list(minutes = 0))         
```

## Player-season totals
```{r}
#| label: get-season-totals-code
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "3|4-6|"
season_box <-
  reg_box |>
  dplyr::group_by(Player, season) |>
  dplyr::summarise(FGM = sum(FGM),FGA = sum(FGA),
    TPM = sum(TPM),TPA = sum(TPA),FTM = sum(FTM),FTA = sum(FTA),
    minutes = sum(minutes), n_games = dplyr::n(),.groups = "drop")
season_box |> dplyr::filter(Player == "Dirk Nowitzki") 
```
. . . 
```{r}
#| label: get-season-totals-eval
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
season_box <-
  reg_box |>
  dplyr::group_by(Player, season) |>
  dplyr::summarise(FGM = sum(FGM),FGA = sum(FGA),
    TPM = sum(TPM),TPA = sum(TPA),FTM = sum(FTM),FTA = sum(FTA),
    minutes = sum(minutes), n_games = dplyr::n(),.groups = "drop")
season_box |> dplyr::filter(Player == "Dirk Nowitzki") 
```

## Who made the most shots?
```{r}
#| label: arrange-fgm
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
season_box |>
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(FGM)) |>
  dplyr::select(Player, season, FGM, FGA, minutes, n_games) |> 
  dplyr::slice_head(n=5)
```
. . .

Is Kobe's 2002-03 performance really better than SGA's 2024-25 performance???

## Field Goal Percentage{.scrollable}
```{r}
#| label: compute-percentages-code
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
season_box <-
  season_box |>
  dplyr::mutate(FGP = ifelse(FGA > 0, FGM/FGA, NA_real_))

```
. . . 

:::{.panel-tabset}
### FGP Leaders
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
season_box |> 
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(FGP)) |>
  dplyr::slice_head(n=5) |>
  dplyr::select(Player, season, FGP)
```

### Another look
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
season_box |> 
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(FGP)) |>
  dplyr::slice_head(n=5) |>
  dplyr::select(Player, season, FGP, FGA)
```

### Restricted Leaders
```{r}
#| label: qualify-fgp
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
season_box |> 
  dplyr::filter(FGA >= 400) |> 
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(FGP)) |>
  dplyr::select(Player, season, FGP, FGA) |>
  dplyr::slice_head(n = 5)
```
:::

## Effective Field Goal Percentage{.scrollable}
- FGP treats 2- and 3-point shots the same!
- $\textrm{eFGP} = (\textrm{FGM} + 0.5 \times \textrm{TPM})/\textrm{FGA}$
```{r}
#| label: compute-efgp
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
season_box <- 
  season_box |> 
  dplyr::mutate(eFGP = (FGM + 0.5 * TPM)/FGA) 
```
. . . 

:::{.panel-tabset}

### Raw eFGP Leaders
```{r}
#| label: efgp-leaders
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
season_box |>
  dplyr::filter(FGA >= 400) |>
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(eFGP), dplyr::desc(FGP)) |>
  dplyr::select(Player, season, eFGP, FGP, TPA, n_games) |>
  dplyr::slice_head(n = 5)
```

### Restricted Leaders
```{r}
#| label: efgp-leaders-filter
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
season_box |>
  dplyr::filter(FGA >= 400 & TPA >= 100) |>
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(eFGP), dplyr::desc(FGP)) |>
  dplyr::select(Player, season, eFGP, FGP, TPA, n_games) |>
  dplyr::slice_head(n = 5)
```

## Takeaways

- No one way to define "best"
- FGM, FGP, and eFGP each have pros & cons
. . .
- Analytics involves **motivating** and **justifying** choices
  - Why this specific question?
  - Why these data?
  - Specific modeling choices
. . .
- We'll consider questions more nuanced than who's the best

<!--
## Summary

- FGM, FGP, eFGP are just  *statistics*
- Analytics tries to answer substantive questions w/ data
- Q: which player had best shooting season?
  - No one way to define "best"
  - Must *motivate* whichever def. we choose
- How can these statistics help competitive advantage?
  - Season-to-season stability?
  - How to predict future performance (esp. w/ small sample sizes)?

  - Ability to predict match- or season-level outcomes
  - Reveal new insight about player valuation
- Extend case study from lecture
  - Construct analogs for another sport
  - Examine season-to-season variability  
 

## Unit 2: Rankings & Simulation
- Use models to *simulate* games, tournaments, drafts, etc.
- Case Studies:
  - NCAA Volleyball & Hockey Tournaments (Lectures 12 & 13)
  - Markov chain simulations (Lecture 14 & 15)
  - Building a consensus mock draft (Lecture 16)

  - Hawkeye for tennis, Hudl for soccer, ...
- Tracking data opens up many possibilities
  - Incorporating spatial info. into prediction models
  - Creating new metrics using tracking data
  - Space ownership & predicting trajectories

## Project 3

- Leverage tracking data
- NFL's Big Data Bowl is a great opportunity
  - Best way into the field (even for non-football sports)
  - Cash prizes & chance to present at Combine
  - Highly encourage you to use BDB submissions for Project 3
  - More info will be posted on Piazza


# Final Reminders

## Course Expectations

- Respect diverse backgrounds
  - Not everyone may knows as much about a sport or method as You
  - You may not know as much about a sport or method as someone else

- Don't hesitate to ask for and to provide help!

- Take care of yourselves & each outer

## Generative AI Expectations 1

- You have the right to the full benefit of my expertise and engagement in this course.
- I will therefore **never** use AI  to
  - To provide feedback on assignments
  - To prepare any course content (e.g., slides, code, assignment flavor-text, etc.)
  - To mediate or assist any communications with you
- Everything you see in the course was created by me without the aid of generative AI

## Generative AI Expectations 2

- A core theme of this class is *practice*
  - It is OK to make mistakes or not know an answer
  - *Process* is more important than results

- Generative AI short-circuits the intended learning process & its use is expressly prohibited

## Warning
:::{.callout-important}
# Peer Review
Respect your classmates enough to review their projects yourself.
Uploading someone else's project report or presentation to a generative AI tool (e.g., for summarization) is forbidden and **will result in a failing grade.**
