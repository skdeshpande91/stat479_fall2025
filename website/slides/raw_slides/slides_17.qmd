## NFL Overtime

- NFL games consist of 4 15-minute quarters
- What happens when the score is tied at the end of Q4?
  - Pre-1974: game declared a tie
  - 1974-2010: "sudden death" overtime
  - 2010-2022: modified sudden death
  - 2022-present: both teams get possession

## Problems w/ Earlier Formats

- Sudden death: first team to score wins
  - One team can take possession, kick a FG, and win
  - Opposing team never possesses ball
  - Huge advantage to team w/ first possession
. . . 

- Modified Sudden Death: can't win with first-possession FG
  - If first team scores TD, game ends
  - If first team kicks FG or doesn't score: second team gets possession
  - Team w/ first possession still has advantage

## Proposed Solution

- Give both teams a chance to possess the ball
- If first team scores a TD, second team has chance to tie/win

. . .

- $\mathbb{P}(\textrm{second team scores TD} \vert \textrm{first team scores TD})$???
  - If prob. very low, is it reasonable to change the rule?
  - If prob. very high,



## Estimating $\mathbb{P}(\textrm{second team scores TD} \vert \textrm{first team scores TD})$

- Idea: use empirical estimate
  - Find all drives following opening-drive TDs in OT
  - Compute proportion ending in TD
- Problem: prior to 2022, there were **no** such drives!

## Model-based Simulation{.smaller}

- Starting context: down, distance, yardline, time, etc.
- Theoretically feasiable to model play components:
  - Play type (run vs pass) given starting context
  - Yards gained & time elapsed given starting context & play type

. . . 

- What about penalties???
  - Pre-snap penalty given starting context
  - Play type given starting context & no pre-snap penalty
  - Penalty during play given starting context & no pre-snap penalty
  - Yards gained & time elapsed given startign context, no penalties
  - Post-play penalty given all else...

## Re-sampling Based Simulation

- Imagine simulating drive play-by-play
- Given starting context:
  - Find pool of *similar* existing plays
  - Randomly sample play from that pool
- Repeat until simulated drive ends

## Challenges

- Unique decision-making environment
- In OT, trailing by $<= 8$ points, second team
  - Will **never** punt or kick of a field goal nor attempt a fake
  - Must score a TD to extend the game
  - Is relatively unconcerned about time
- How to define "similar"??

## Plan

1. Build a pool of plays from which to sample
2. Determine dist. of starting positions for second OT drive
3. Write function to sample similar play
4. Simulate & visualize drives
