## Overview

## Multi-level models

<!--
  This is by no means a comprehensive review
  I **highly** recommend checking out the Chapter 8 of the book *Beyond *, which you can find online [here](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ch-multilevelintro.html#twolevelmodeling).

### Motivation:
rouped data, when we fit linear models there is an assumption about independence across observations
  In the context of our football data, there's actually quite a bit of grouping structure: play-to-play, it is not likely that the observations are similarly independent as they involve a lot of the same players.
If a player is very skilled, we would expect the outcome to be high.

<!--
  Do a QB only model. We could fit a linaer model only to the data for QB 1; we can then look at the intercepts across players
  Level 2: asserts that in fact each alpha_i = alpha_0 + u_i 

  Fixed effects are the unknown population effects associated with certain covariates; in the case of an intercept only mode
  The individual alpha_i's serve to conceptually link Level 1 and Lever 2.
  Together, we can write this as a composite model

  random effects descrie levels of a factor that can be thought of a sample from a larger population of factor levels. 

  Useful to always start with a random intercept model.
  compare estimated variacne in within-person deviations to variance in between-person deviations. This gives rise to an intraclass correlation coefficient

## A more elaborate multi-level model

Up to this point, we fit models that gave all credit to the quarterback.
This is patently absurd.

We need to also allocate credit to recievers.

And we need to adjust for many many covariates
