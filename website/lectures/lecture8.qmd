<!--
  0. Set up a guide for scraping savant data: link to Bill Petti's website
  1. Scrape pitch-by-pitch for a single season (2024); this takes a while!
  2. Fit a GAM : p_throws + stand + s(plate_x, plate_z)
  3. Take the estimated p-hat and convert to logistic scale; then do a mixed-model with player-level random effects
  4. Suggest pitch framing estimate as a project
