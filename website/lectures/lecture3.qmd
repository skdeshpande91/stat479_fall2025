## Overview

### Key Topics

We will start with logistic regression and then move on to regression trees and ensembles to steadily improve our 

Logistic regression

Random forests


## An initial XG model


Intuitively, we expect shots taken very close to the goal to have larger xG than shots taken very far from the goal

### Handcrafting features


### Adding interactions
It may not just be distance and body part but their interaction; 

## Tree-based models

Adding more covariates and interactions becomes extremely tricky.
Methods based on regression trees are a convenient way to overcome this limitation.

### Illustration


## GK metrics

To what extent does a keeper affect XG?
To answer this this, we can fit two XG models. One with keeper information and one without.
We can then compare the two different XG values
Consider a model that includes goal keeper position one without.
