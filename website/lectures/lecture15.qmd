## Overview

## Beyond Run Scoring

### Game State After 2 Batters



## Incorporating Team Information

Our Markov chain simulations have, so far, assumed that the transition probabilities between states are identical for all teams.
This simplified assumption overlooks important differences between batting and pitching abilities.

### Empirical Bayes Shrinkage Estimator
<!--
  Raw estimates are not so good
  Stein shrinakge estimator: for each starting state s, let n_t be the number of time team t is starting state t. Fix an ending state s'.
  We observe yt which is the number of times team t goes to state 
  Derive a stein-like shriknage estimator
  Albert & Baumer & Marchi do a weighted average that pull to grand mean
