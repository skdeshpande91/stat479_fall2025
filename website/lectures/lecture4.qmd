## Overview

### Key Topics

Expected runs framework





## From pitch-by-pitch to plate appearance



<!--
  1. How to scrape pitch-by-pitch data from StatCast
  2. How to get plate appearances? Filter down to the smallest 
  3. Clean up certain fields
-->


## Expected Runs

<!--
  Definition, based on the 24 combinations of outs and baserunners
  Build the matrix
  Add EPA start and EPA after for each plate appearance. Also get number of runs scored in that plate appearance
-->


### Adjusting for platoon advantages & park effects



<!--
  Regress delta onto park and indicator Bhand == Phand
  Get those residuals and add them to the data frame
-->


## Base-running

Quote from Baumer et al. "baserunners should only get credit for advancement beyond what would be expected given their starting locations, number of outs, and the hitting event that occurred"
<!--
  Regress residuals (epsilon) from above onto indicators for gamestate; hitting event that occured
  Resulting residual (eta): represent the portion of the adjusted oï¬€ensive run value that is attributable to the baserunners.
-->
### Expected base advancement

## Batting

<!--
eta: portion of adjusted offensive run value attributable to baserunners.
mu = epsilon-eta attributable to the hitter
** need to compare batter relative to other players at his position **

-->
