## Recap & Overview

Last lecture, we introduce two-level models.

Our plan will be to compute the player's average effect (their "individual points added (iPA)") for three different types of offensive production: rushing players, passing plays (air yards), and passing plays (yards after catch)

## Passing Model 1: Air yards



## Passing Model 2: Yards after Catch

## Rushing Model

## Individual Points Above Average & Replacement Level

### Computing a player's iPAA
<!--
  QB: k_{p,pass} is number of pass attempts, k_{p,rush} is sum of rush attempts, scrambles, and sacks
  For non-QB; k_{p,pass} number of targets, p_{p,rush} is number of rush attempts

Summing over all three components gives player p's individual points added above average, iPAA_{p}

-->
### Position-specific replacement levels



## From points to wins

<!--
  For each team, let us regress the number of wins onto the score differential
  1/hat{beta} is the number of points per win.; take iPAR and divide by esimated points per win (i.e., multiply iPAR by beta)
-->

<!--
  Do a QB only model. We could fit a linaer model only to the data for QB 1; we can then look at the intercepts across players
  Level 2: asserts that in fact each alpha_i = alpha_0 + u_i 

  Fixed effects are the unknown population effects associated with certain covariates; in the case of an intercept only mode
  The individual alpha_i's serve to conceptually link Level 1 and Lever 2.
  Together, we can write this as a composite model

  random effects descrie levels of a factor that can be thought of a sample from a larger population of factor levels. 

  Useful to always start with a random intercept model.
  compare estimated variacne in within-person deviations to variance in between-person deviations. This gives rise to an intraclass correlation coefficient
