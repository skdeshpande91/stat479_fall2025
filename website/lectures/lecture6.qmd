## Conditional expectations revisited


<!--
  1. We previously considered XG and run expectancy. The idea is that our observed data (shots in the case of XG and plate-appearances in the case of run expectacy) consisted of a collection of features X and an outcome Y. In the case of XG, X were features about a particular shot (e.g., body part, technique, distance from the goal/keeper) and Y was an
  And in the case of run expectancy, X consisted of the
  2. The formal definition of XG provides a few interpretations: (i) say we could repeatedly play the shot or PA over and over and over again. Each time we do that, we observe a different draw from the slice of the population. 
  3. Figure (from 333 lectures) visualizes this. How the mean value of Y changes as we vary x
  
  Given a large collection of features $\boldsymbol{\mathbf{x}}$ about a shot, $\textrm{XG}(\boldsymbol{\mathbf{x}}) = \mathbb{E}[Y \vert \boldsymbol{\mathbf{X}} = \boldsymbol{\mathbf{x}}],$ where $Y$ is a binary indicator of whether or not the shot resulted in a goal.

## Parametric Statistical Models

### Linear Regression


<!--
  Take our StatCast data, do a linear regression with no intercept
-->

### Logistic Regression

<!--
  XG model based on distance
-->

### Generalized Additive Models

<!--
  We saw in section 5 that we can expand this 
-->

## Nonparametric Metrics


### Regression Trees

### Random Forests

### XGBoost
