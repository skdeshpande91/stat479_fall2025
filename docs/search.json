Emphasizes not only technical calculation of advanced metrics but also on written and oral communication to other data scientists and to non-technical audience. Topics may include: deriving team rankings from paired competitions; measuring an individual player’s contribution to their team’s overall success; assessing player performance and team strategy in terms of expected outcomes; forecasting the impact of new rule changes using simulation; and creating new metrics using high-resolution player tracking data.\nLearning Outcomes: Throughout the course you will\n\nImplement appropriate statistical methods to assess player and team performance\nWork with play-by-play and high-resolution tracking data\nProvide constructive and actionable feedback on your peers’ analytic reports\nBuild a personal portfolio of sports data analyses\n\nLocation & Schedule: Tuesdays & Thursdays, 11:00am-12:15pm, 1524 Morgridge Hall\nInstructor & Office Hours: Sameer Deshpande (sameer.deshpande@wisc.edu).

We will also make extensive use of the packages glmnet, ranger, and xgboost for model fitting. We will occassionally also use ggplot2 for creating visualizations.\nAs the course progresses, we will introduce and install new package as required. For the most part, these packages will be specific to a particular sport (e.g., in Lecture 1 we will use the nbastatR to access NBA player box-score statistics).\nEvery package that we will use in this class is available through either (i) the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) or (ii) a public GitHub repository maintained by the packager developer. We typically install CRAN packages using the install.packages() command. To install packages hosted on GitHub, we will use the install_github function in the devtools package (which itself is available on CRAN)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired installations\n\n\n\nPrior to Lecture 2, please make sure you have installed the tidyverse packages as well as devtools, ggplot2, glmnet, ranger, and xgboost.\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"devtools\", \"tidyverse\", \"ggplot2\", \n                   \"glmnet\", \"ranger\", \"xgboost\"))",
